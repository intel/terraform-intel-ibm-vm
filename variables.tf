# In this block the code determines the minimum CPU platform based on the machine type that the use has selected. We always recommend our customers to use the 
# latest generation of Intel CPU platforms that are publicly available . As of the date of this repo creation, the General Purpose bx2-2x8 instances can be on either Ice Lake 
# or Cascade Lake for the same price. For better price and performance, we are recommendaing to use Intel Ice Lake instances where possible.
